# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
first lesson with neural network
Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project is my first acquaintance with neural networks and TensorFlow in particular. 
I started by exploring the official TensorFlow guide and decided to work with a pre-existing model. 
I added a graphical interface for drawing digits and used this idea as inspiration from a YouTube tutorial. 
The goal was to have fun and gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow and neural networks.

Features
Graphical interface for drawing handwritten digits
Uses the MNIST dataset for training and testing
Trained model for recognizing handwritten digits
Real-time prediction and visualization of the predicted digit

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python (version 3.7 or above)
TensorFlow (version 2.0 or above)
tkinter package
PIL package

You can install the required packages using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt

Getting Started
1.Clone this repository
2. run tf.model.py and compile the model and save it
3. run main.py 

Usage
1.Draw a digit on the canvas by clicking and dragging the mouse.
2.The application will predict the drawn digit in real-time and display it on the screen.
3.The histogram sidebar shows the prediction probabilities for each digit. 
Blue bars represent the predicted probabilities, while red bars indicate a mismatch between the prediction and the actual digit value.
4.To clear the canvas, click the "Clear" button.
